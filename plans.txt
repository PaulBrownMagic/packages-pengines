Plans
=====

Short term
----------

- we may need another time_limit, destroying a pengine that hasn't been used at all for a certain period of time.

- split up into different files, making it easier to add stuff such as a state machine interpreter.
One suggestion would be:
+ pengine_core.pl
+ pengine_event_loop.pl
+ pengine_rpc.pl

- evolve test_pengines.pl

- finalize Scratchpad


Long term
----------

- REST-based predicate pengine_rest(+URL, +Query, +Options) where options can be cursor(_) and limit(_).  Can probably be built on top of the core.

- look at ways to make siblings communicate

- experiment with non-prolog pengines, i.e. pengines that accept Prolog queries, and respond with Prolog terms, but are NOT implemented in Prolog.
